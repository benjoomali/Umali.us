We had a fantastic time on our two week honeymoon to Italy. Please enjoy some of the pictures from the trip below. Thank you all for your support and and your love!

After the wedding, we took off to the airport to fly to Rome, Italy. 

## Newly Wed Blessing at The Vatican 
Danielle did a great job getting us tickets and planning a time to get us to the Vatican. Once a month, the Pope will bless newly weds during his weekday "service" where he addresses the people. Many from all over fly in with their Wedding dresses and Suits in order to get blessed.

Unfortunately, the best we could do was get this close to Papa Francis. It was still an experience and we were grateful to get his blessing.

## Rome, Italy

We were able to visit various land marks such as The Colosseo  where we were able to be ON the floor where gladiators fought.

We saw the pantheon where people still come to worship and pray, the Trevi Fountain where we wished for luck and continuous blessings for our marriage, The Roman Forum where old ruins are still standing strong, and the The Sistine Chapel which was such a BEAUTIFUL place.

It was amazing how one man had such a beautiful image of God and man and could create it with his two hands.

A few days later we visited The Spanish Steps where we lost our breath climbing them, Palatine Hill where lots of ruins and the aquaducts still stand, The Villa Borghese where we were able to see Rome at a hill and enjoyed the gigantic park. We rented an electric two seater bike and strolled around the park for the day.

We also got to see landmarks like the Pantheon, which is a structural marvel!

Our favorite landmark is the Santa Maria in Cosmedin. St. Andrew’s Parish (the church we got married in) was modeled after this church in Rome. We went on a search to find it and we were able to see it and take a picture! It was very special to have found it.

## Siena, Tuscany

We stayed at this beautiful and serene hotel that allowed us to take a break from the hustle and bustle of Rome. It was really quiet and peaceful. We visited some wineries to teach us about wines and parings. We even took home some wine (our favorite was the Chianti Classico Reserve). We visited a very famous place where one of the most famous wines (Brunellos) are made, Montalcino. The town was a small but beautiful old town. 

One of our favorite stops was during a Wine Tour. We stopped in San Gimignano (home of the best Gelato in the world)

We were able to see the Duomo di Siena which was one of the most beautiful churches! It was built so colorfully and its dome stood so high! We didn’t get to climb it that day unfortunately (the reservations for that get booked very early in advance!).

## Florence

We stayed at a very nice hotel on the river across from a very large hill overlooking all of Florence. This was one of our favorite cities that we visited! We would love to come back again and visit this city alone! It was just full of things to see, eat and do! We visited the Galileo Museum and it was such an educational place to visit.

Here in Florence, we were able to take a tour of the city and learned about the Medici family and their power that was held within the city! (There’s apparently a show on Netflix about it that we’d love to get into!). We saw another very large and beautiful church called the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore. It was gorgeous outside! The cupola was painted with a gigantic mural of various biblical scenes.

We also saw the David at the Accademia Gallery!!

One of our favorite things that we did was take a cooking class! We were able to select high quality meats and produce from a farmers market and was able to taste the wholeness in our food. We learned to make pasta from scratch as well as sauces that Ben and Danielle still make at home to this day. We also learned how to make Tiramisu which is one of Danielle’s favorite desserts.

## Positano
For the final part of the trip, we got to spend a few days relaxing in the Amalfi Coast. Ben was scared of driving the winding cliffs, but once we got into it, it was a really exciting adventure!

The Amalfi Coast is beautiful! The beaches are blue. Unfortunately, instead of sand they have pebbles (that really hurt when you step on them!)

We also traveled by boat to visit the island of Capri.

Thanks for reading! And thank you for being so supportive of our marriage and our relationship.
