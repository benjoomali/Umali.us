We had a fantastic time on our two week honeymoon to Italy. Please enjoy some of the pictures from the trip below. Thank you all for your support and and your love!

## Rome, Italy
After the wedding, we took off to the airport to fly to Rome, Italy. 
## Newly Wed Blessing at The Vatican 
Danielle did a great job getting us tickets and planning a time to get us to the Vatican. Once a month, the Pope will bless newly weds during his weekday "service" where he addresses the people. Many from all over fly in with their Wedding dresses and Suits in order to get blessed.

Unfortunately, the best we could do was get this close to Papa Francis. It was still an experience and we were grateful to get his blessing.
